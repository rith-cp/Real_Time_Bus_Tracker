# Real_Time_Bus_Tracker

A small mapping program where it shows the map of Cambridge, MA where you can find two of the best universities in the US, MIT and Harvard. It also has a big button that you can click on and it will show you the pointed route you can take from MIT to Harvard.

# How to Run

Simply click on "github-pages" under "Environments" and then click on "View Deployment". Or you can just download the whole repository and run the index.HTML file on a browser from your local computer.

# Future Improvement

I am planning on adding a colored line to each point to make it more standout as a direction from A to B. And it can also be able to show direction to multiple places.
